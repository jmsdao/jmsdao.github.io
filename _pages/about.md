Regardless of [my current areas of focus](https://jmsdao.github.io/), my ultimate mission is to meaningfully participate in the collective project of stewarding humanity towards enabling flourishing and well-being for all.

For most my life, I was looking at my feet and taking small, comfortable steps. I was decent at math and physics in high school, so I elected to study engineering at university. I wasn't sure what career to go into, so I went to my university's careers fair. I didn't know how to choose one job from another, so I just chose the job offer that marginally had the highest salary. And after a short stint in quantitative trading, I finally looked up at the horizon and realised I was [climbing the wrong hill](https://cdixon.org/2009/09/19/climbing-the-wrong-hill).

Since then, various [intellectual influences](https://jmsdao.github.io/mind/) have radically shaped how I view the world, and how I orient and find my place in the world.

Aside from the casual "try to do good for the world" stuff, I'm also into fitness and weird self-improvement.
