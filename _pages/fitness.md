### Before & After

### Nutrition
- Most days, >90% of my calories come from whole-foods plant-based sources:
	- Calories: currently going for between 1500-1800 a day to try and drop body fat. I seem to have an usually low metabolism, or have a body that's unusually efficient at extracting calories from food, as I don't need very many calories to maintain weight
	- Protein: around 90-110g per day. Mostly from TVP, tofu and rice/pea protein power, and incidentally from lentils, beans/legumes, nuts/seeds
	- Fats: around 50-65g per day. Generally from nuts, seeds, nut butters and oils. Pretty standard
	- Carbs: around 160-200g per day. Can vary a lot, but staples are oats, bran, white/brown rice, wholemeal/wholegrain bread and in-season fruit
	- Micronutrients: Loosely taking the [Daily Dozen](https://nutritionfacts.org/app/uploads/2018/03/metric.png) approach and including a mix of vegetables per day, with an emphasis on leafy greens and cruciferous vegetables
- Morning supplements (big fan of using [pill organizers](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0069/6464/1905/products/Aidapt-One-Month-Pill-Organiser-Vm931Ac_1_grande.jpg?v=1586180846)):
	- Vitamin D3 (daily, 2000-3000 IUs)
	- Zinc (daily, approx. 30mg elemental equivalent)
	- Omega-3s (daily, 360mg EPA/240mg DHA)
	- Creatine (daily, about 4g)
	- B12 (twice a week, 1000ug)
- Night-time supplements:
	- Magnesium (daily, approx. 320mg elemental equivalent)

### Training
- Every week I usually do 2x upper body sessions, 2x lower body sessions and 1x light cardio session
	- Upper body training is predominantly calisthenics strength training, with some weight training in the mix
	- Lower body training is mostly mobility and flexibility, with some amount of [Kneesovertoes](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheKneesovertoesguy/videos) style joint strengthening
	- Cardio is usually 10 - 20 minutes of jogging or stationary bike work
